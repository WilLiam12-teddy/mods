The Morelights modpack adds over 30 lighting and accessory nodes to suit various styles of builds, both interior and exterior.
Includes basic light blocks, modern and historical-style lighting, and customizable street lamps.

Some nodes (ceiling lights, bar lights, poles) can be rotated to serve different purposes.

The modpack currently supports both Minetest Game and MineClone 2.
